**PYTHON - HELLO, WORLD (PROJECT 11 | WEEK 05)**

# INTRODUCTION/OVERVIEW

This project seeks to orient us into the basic of python throught hte commonly known "hello, world" beginner structure.

# LEARNING OBJECTIVES

The objectives are to get us familiar with python as a programming language, the available data types, variables, classes and identifiers through a series of tasks.

# TASKS

The following tasks will need to completed and checked with the in-built intranet code checker, but only after the quiz with 18 questions has been cleared;

0. Hello, print(5pts)
1. Copy - Cut - Paste(8pts)
2. Positive anything is better than negative nothing(14pts)
3. The last digit(14pts)
4. Hexadecimal printing(5pts)
5. 00...99(5pts)
6. Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need
   (5pts).

# MANUAL REVIEW

Unlike the previous project, each task would need to be reviewed by the automatic checker on the intranet, SO once a task is complete, proceed to click on the "check your code" button to receive a score. Please note, you will not receive a score until all fails are corrected and cleared by the checker.

# CONCLUSION

I hope this has been an insightful README and you have all the information needed to navigative this directory. If not, let me know in the comments and I will make the necessary modifications. Do not forget to check out the resources referenced below.
