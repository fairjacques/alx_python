**PYTHON - IMPORTS & MODULES (PROJECT 16 | WEEK 06)**

# INTRODUCTION/OVERVIEW

With this project, we learn about importing files and parts of files(functions) into another file by calling the function from the imported file, building on our knowlege of functions acquired from previous projects.

# LEARNING OBJECTIVES

The objectives are to get us familiar with creating and importing modules.

# TASKS

The following tasks will need to be completed and checked with the in-built intranet code checker;

0. Import a simple function from a simple file
   (14pts)
1. How to make a script dynamic!(14pts)
2. Everything can be imported(11pts)
3. Integers division with debug(9pts)
4. Raise exception(10pts)
5. Raise a message(8pts)

# MANUAL REVIEW

For this project, each task would need to be reviewed by the automatic checker on the intranet, so once a task is complete, proceed to click on the "check your code" button to receive a score. Please note, you will not receive a score until all fails are corrected and cleared by the checker.

# CONCLUSION

I hope this has been an insightful README and you have all the information needed to navigative this directory. If not, let me know in the comments and I will make the necessary modifications. Do not forget to check out the resources referenced below.
